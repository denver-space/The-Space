      <Fragment slot="desc"> Simple Baseline Pricing. No Surprises. <br/> <br/>
        <br/>We're creating The Space from the ground up. We need to build a treasury and complete formal steps to offer the premeir bitcoin hub. <br/>
        <br/>As a result, we've decided to start collecting membership dues prior to offering a physical location and all of our intended member benefits. <br/>
        Your founding support helps us make this vision a reality and solidify Denver's global bitcoin influence. <br/><br/>
        Founding Membership dues are discounted from baseline pricing until we open the physical location.
