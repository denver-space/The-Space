## The Space - Founding Roadmap

The Space is a grass-roots bitcoin social hub and communtiy that we're starting from scratch. We are building this citadel from inception to reality with the help of various founding members and sponsors across the Rocky Mountain region.

This effort began in the fall of 2023, when several regular attendees of Denver BitDevs decided it was time to create something special for the local bitcoin community. Over the following months, a handful of leaders took responsibility to make it happen. We've made great progress, yet still have much to do. This blog post will outline at a high level everything done, and to be done, as we bring The Space to life.
