## The Space - Founding Roadmap

The Space is a ground-up, grass-roots bitcoin social hub and communtiy. We are building this vision from inception to reality with the help of various founding members in the Rocky Mountain region.

This effort began in the fall of 2023, when several members of Denver BitDevs decided it was time to create something special for the bitcoin community. Over the following months, a handful of leaders took responsibility to make it happen. We've made great progress, yet still have much to do. This blog post will outline everything done, and to be done as we bring The Space to life.
